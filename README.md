# DEF CON 29: Inspecting Signals from Satellites to Shock Collars

This is the repository holds content from the DEF CON 29 workshop [Inspecting Sginals from Satellites to Shock Collars](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/inspecting-signals-from-satellites-to-shock-collars-las-vegas-12-tickets-162215666425). The workshop will took place in person at DEF CON 29 on Friday, August 6 from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM PDT. Files generated and used during the class have been be uploaded here so students can continue to play after the workshop.

  * **Abstract:**
 Invisible signals control everything from satellites to shock collars. Wireless security can be intimidating, especially when research requires a low-level understanding of the many ways radio waves can carry data. The concept of using light to send messages is not hard to grasp, but the several abstraction layers between physical radio waves and decoded data packets obscure what is really happening when wireless devices communicate. By examining several topics that are rarely presented together, this workshop provides the introduction to wireless hacking that we both wish we had when starting out. If you want the ability to see and manipulate the unseen, this workshop is for you.
  * **Level:** Intermediate
  * **Pre-Requisites:**  Students are expected to have basic familiarity with the Linux command line.
  * **Required Materials:**  Students will need to bring a wifi-enabled laptop with a modern browser.



## Additional Notes

We created a four-hour workshop for DEF CON 29 as a way to share knowledge that we wish we had when starting out with wireless security. Too often, the low-level side of wireless is presented with hand waves and labels of "black magic". We hoped to help alleviate some of this with this workshop.

If you go hunting for wireless resources, there is a wealth of information that can be found in books and online. However, it can be challenging to consolidate this mass of this information into a coherent mental model for wireless communications, especially at some of the lower levels. Because of the limited size of the workshop, we decided to clean up our notes for some of the earlier units in the workshop and present them here. Additionally, we have included several references for further study.

Over time, we hope to convert more of our workshop into a workbook format, so feel free to
star this repository for future updates.
