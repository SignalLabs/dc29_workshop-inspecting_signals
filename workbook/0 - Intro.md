## Intro

Abstraction layers conceal complexity. Because “complexity is the enemy of security”, the space between abstraction layers is a lucrative place for hackers to investigate.

This workshop is a tour across several abstraction layers that exist in wireless communication. Be ready for several scene changes along the way. We only have a short amount of time to traverse some expansive areas, but passing many of the important locations along the way will hopefully help you build a better map for future wireless exploration.

A common approach to teaching wireless security is to start with practical lessons focused on higher abstraction layers (e.g., capturing and cracking WPA handshakes) and then, if there is interest, help the motivated students work back down to the lower abstraction layers. This approach risks leaving students with knowledge without understanding.

Although we only have a limited amount of time, we are going to start this tour at the lower abstraction layers (building a general understanding of waves) and eventually work our way up towards the higher layers (manipulating wireless packets). While this may not be the quickest way for us to level up student’s practical skills, we hope you will leave this workshop with a better understanding of wireless technology and feel more empowered to look in places many researchers are too intimidated to explore.
